          "Al llegar a Mercurio, seremos recibidos por una vista espectacular de su paisaje desértico y escarpado. Nuestra primera parada será el cráter Caloris, uno de los mayores tesoros geológicos del planeta y el lugar más cálido de este. Este inmenso cráter, formado por el impacto de un meteorito, tiene más de 1,500 kilómetros de diámetro y está rodeado por montañas impresionantes y cráteres enormes, puede considerarse inclusive una llanura por su inmenso tamaño. Aquí podremos apreciar los picos centrales y la asombrosa topografía del cráter. Este se formo con el impacto de un gran asteroide, cuando Mercurio era un planeta joven. Dicha área se inundó de lava, se enfrió y se volvió brillante, destacando así en toda esa área.",
